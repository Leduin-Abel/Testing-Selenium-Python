# Testing-Selenium-Python

My introduction to Selenium WebDriver with Python following the test automation university course.

I've added the repo created by the course instructor Andy Knight as a submodule in order to follow the course properly. 

## Fixtures

They are special functions that make sure everything gets set up, cleaned up and the dependencies are properly injected 

## Python packages

These files are headed by files called <__init__.py>, which is just for the machine to know that the you are using a package and to treat it as such 

## Different browsers

When writing automated tests with Selenium WebDriver or any web-based test, regardless of  language, one should always avoid hard-coding the browser into the tests because this limits the versatility of said tests.
